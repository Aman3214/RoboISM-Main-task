<p>The provided code has function for two potentiometer one for sleep and another for pwm ie values v1 and v2 but i had only one so i took the liberty to use only one potentiometer value "v1" for both the leds where the red one is for pwm and the green one is for the sleep timer with specified function ie 10% rotation is light off after 1 min  </p>
